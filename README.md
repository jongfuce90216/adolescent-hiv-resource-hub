# Adolescent HIV Resource Hub

## Mission Statement

This project aims to create a continuously updated, community-sourced digital resource guide for adolescents living with or at risk for HIV, as well as healthcare providers working with this population. Our goal is to provide reliable, up-to-date information on local HIV testing sites, youth-friendly clinics, mental health support services, PrEP access points, and educational materials. By fostering transparent collaboration through open-source principles, we strive to improve access to care and reduce AIDS-related deaths among adolescents.
